# AWS ACM Wildcard (Using CloudFlare DNS)

This module generates AWS ACM SSL Certificates for a given CloudFlare DNS Zone in regions us-west-2 & us-east-1. 

*It should be noted that this module uses an anti-pattern as it includes providers for AWS in two regions. Removing these resources if needed is currently a manual process. Once resources are removed you should also manually remove them from your terraform state.*
